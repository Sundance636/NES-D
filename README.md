# NES Projects
This is just a work space showcase my tech demos and projects I wrote in 6502 Assembly for the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System).

## Usage
Each Folder will have a 'test' file (with no extension) which is the compiled game code, so just open your prefered NES Emulator (<a href="https://fceux.com/web/home.html">FCEUX</a> Recommended) and start the the selected ROM.
